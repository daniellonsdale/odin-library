The Odin Project library project using prototypal objects in JavaScript and vanilla html/css - https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library

Reflection:
- Overall, I'm pretty happy with this project
- I think I was able to learn most of what I've learned so far rather effectively
- I think I could make the javascript more efficient and the CSS more elegant
- I'd like to add CSS animations to this project and responsiveness after I learn them
